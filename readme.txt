This is a Wordpress widget to display a status from http://ping.fm in your sidebar.  It timestamps the status and makes any URLs it finds clickable.

== Description ==

Ping.fm (http://ping.fm) is a simple service that makes updating your social networks a snap.  You can use AIM, GTalk, iGoogle, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, WAP, iPhone/iPod Touch, SMS or E-mail to let Ping.fm relay your message to a multitude of social networking sites.  This plugin lets you use Ping.fm to add your status to your Wordpress Blog's sidebar via Ping.fm's "Custom URL" integration.

== Installation ==

* Extract archive
* Upload entire 'pingfm-status' directory to 'wordpress/wp-content/plugins'
  -- do not remove files from directory, upload the directory with all files in it
* At http://ping.fm create a Custom URL to update the following address:
     'http://url-to-your-wordpress-installation/wp-content/plugins/pingfm-status/pingfm-post.php'
* Enable the plugin in your Wordpress admin section
* Add pingfm widget to your sidebar, set the Title

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If you notice that the timezone is incorrect on the timestamps that appear in your updates, 
you can change it in '/wp-content/plugins/pingfm-status/pingfm-post.php'.  I have included
some notes in that file.
